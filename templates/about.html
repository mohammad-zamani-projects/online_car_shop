    <br><h1>About us:</h1>
    <br><p>
        A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels.<br>
        Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than cargo.<br>
        There are around one billion cars in use worldwide.<br>

The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.<br>
        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.<br>
        Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century.<br>
        The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-producedand mass-affordablecars, respectively.<br>
        Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.<br>
        In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.<br>
        In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.<br>


Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps.<br>
        Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex.<br>
        These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.<br>
        Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.<br>
        Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and widespread in the 2020s.<br>
        The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.<br>
